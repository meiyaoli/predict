Upon intravenous administration, the BXQ-350 nanovesicle formulation selectively targets and preferentially accumulates in tumor vessels and cells, due to the leaky nature of tumor vasculature and the presence of phosphatidylserine (PS) lipids in tumor cell membranes. Upon binding to the phospholipids in the tumor cell membrane, SapC fuses with the membrane and is internalized leading to its accumulation within the internal membrane. SapC becomes active in the acidic tumor microenvironment and as a lysosomal sphingolipid activator protein, activates lysosomal enzymes, such as beta-glucosidase, acid sphingomyelinase, and beta-galactosylceramidase. This leads to the degradation of glucosylceramide and sphingomyelin, and the conversion of galactosylceramide to ceramide, respectively. This elevates intracellular ceramide levels, activates caspases and induces ceramide-mediated apoptosis, which together lead to an inhibition of tumor cell growth.

After hydrolysis in vivo, 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN38), an active metabolite of irinotecan, is released from firtecan pegol; 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin selectively stabilizes topoisomerase I-DNA covalent complexes, resulting in single-stranded and double-stranded DNA breaks, the inhibition of DNA replication, and the induction of apoptosis. This agent is designed to deliver the active metabolite to tumor cells without the need for conversion as is the case with irinotecan. Compared to unPEGylated 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin, PEGylation improves solubility and allows for parental delivery, and may result in a longer half-life and higher exposure for tumor cells.",ncit:C70651,,New PD,

Fenofibrate is hydrolyzed in vivo to its active metabolite fenofibric acid that binds to and activates peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha), resulting in the activation of lipoprotein lipase and reduction of the production of apoprotein C-III, an inhibitor of lipoprotein lipase activity. Increased lipolysis and a fall in plasma triglycerides, in turn, leads to the modification of the small, dense low density lipoporotein (LDL) particles into larger particles that are catabolized more rapidly due to a greater affinity for cholesterol receptors. In addition, activation of PPARalpha also increases the synthesis of apoproteins A-I, A-II, and high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol. Overall, fenofibrate reduces total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, total triglycerides and triglyceride rich lipoprotein (VLDL) while increasing HDL cholesterol.",ncit:C29047|rxcui:8703,,New PD,

Upon administration, gemcitabine is converted into the active metabolites difluorodeoxycytidine diphosphate (dFdCDP) and difluorodeoxycytidine triphosphate (dFdCTP) by deoxycytidine kinase. dFdCTP competes with deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP) and is incorporated into DNA. This locks DNA polymerase thereby resulting in ""masked termination"" during DNA replication. On the other hand, dFdCDP inhibits ribonucleotide reductase, thereby decreasing the deoxynucleotide pool available for DNA synthesis. The reduction in the intracellular concentration of dCTP potentiates the incorporation of dFdCTP into DNA.",ncit:C66876|rxcui:12574,,,

This agent inhibits TK encoded by the bcr-abl oncogene as well as receptor TKs encoded by the c-kit and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) oncogenes. Inhibition of the bcr-abl TK results in decreased proliferation and enhanced apoptosis in malignant cells of Philadelphia-positive (Ph+) hematological malignancies such as CML and ALL; effects on c-kit TK activity inhibit mast-cell and cellular proliferation in those diseases overexpressing c-kit, such as mastocytosis and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST).",ncit:C1687|rxcui:284924,,,

Complementary to the template region of telomerase (hTR) RNA, imetelstat acts as a competitive enzyme inhibitor that binds and blocks the active site of the enzyme (a telomerase template antagonist), a mechanism of action which differs from that for the antisense oligonucleotide-mediated inhibition of telomerase activity through telomerase mRNA binding. Inhibition of telomerase activity in tumor cells by imetelstat results in telomere shortening, which leads to cell cycle arrest or apoptosis.",ncit:C49084,,New PD,

Irinotecan, a prodrug, is converted to a biologically active metabolite 7-ethyl-10-hydroxy-camptothecin (SN-38) by a carboxylesterase-converting enzyme. One thousand-fold more potent than its parent compound irinotecan, SN-38 inhibits topoisomerase I activity by stabilizing the cleavable complex between topoisomerase I and DNA, resulting in DNA breaks that inhibit DNA replication and trigger apoptotic cell death.

Metformin is not metabolized and is excreted unchanged by the kidneys.",ncit:C61612|rxcui:6809,,New PD,
PD,,,,,,Atorvastatin,"A synthetic lipid-lowering agent. Atorvastatin competitively inhibits hepatic hydroxymethyl-glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the enzyme which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, a key step in cholesterol synthesis. Atorvastatin also increases the number of LDL receptors on hepatic cell surfaces to enhance uptake and catabolism of LDL and reduces LDL production and the number of LDL particles.

PD,,,,,,Procarbazine Hydrochloride,"The hydrochloride salt of a methylhydrazine derivative with antineoplastic and mutagenic activities. Although the exact mode of cytotoxicity has not been elucidated, procarbazine, after metabolic activation, appears to inhibit the trans-methylation of methionine into transfer RNA (t-RNA), thereby preventing protein synthesis and consequently DNA and RNA synthesis.

Perifosine has a lower gastrointestinal toxicity profile than the related agent miltefosine. (NCI04)",ncit:C1727,,New PD,
PD,,,,,,Gefitinib,"An anilinoquinazoline with antineoplastic activity. Gefitinib inhibits the catalytic activity of numerous tyrosine kinases including the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which may result in inhibition of tyrosine kinase-dependent tumor growth.

PD,,,,,,Cyclosporine,"A natural cyclic polypeptide immunosuppressant isolated from the fungus Beauveria nivea. The exact mechanism of action of cyclosporine is not known but may involve binding to the cellular protein cytophilin, resulting in inhibition of the enzyme calcineurin. This agent appears to specifically and reversibly inhibit immunocompetent lymphocytes in the G0-or G1-phase of the cell cycle. T-lymphocytes are preferentially inhibited with T-helper cells as the primary target. Cyclosporine also inhibits lymphokine production and release. (NCI04)",ncit:C406|rxcui:3008,,New PD,
PD,,,,,,Tretinoin,"A naturally-occurring acid of retinol. Tretinoin binds to and activates retinoic acid receptors (RARs), thereby inducing changes in gene expression that lead to cell differentiation, decreased cell proliferation, and inhibition of tumorigenesis.

PD,,,,,,Antineoplaston A10,"A piperidinedione antineoplaston with potential antineoplastic activity.  Antineoplaston A10 was originally isolated from human urine but is now synthetically derived.  This agent intercalates into DNA, resulting in cell cycle arrest in G1 phase, reduction of mitosis, and decreased protein synthesis.  Antineoplaston A10 may also inhibit ras-oncogene expression and activate tumor suppressor gene p53, leading to cell differentiation and apoptosis. (NCI04)",ncit:C1004,,New PD,
PD,,,,,,Antineoplaston AS2-1,"A 4:1 mixture of phenylacetate and phenylacetylgluatmine, degradation products of the antineoplaston agent A10.

PD,,,,,,Itacnosertib,"An orally bioavailable inhibitor of activin A receptor type 1 (activin receptor-like kinase 2; ALK2; ALK-2; ACRV1), with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon oral administration,itacnosertib targets, binds to and inhibits the activity of ALK-2. This prevents ALK-2-mediated signaling and inhibits cell growth in ALK-2-overexpressing tumor cells. In addition, in cancer and inflammatory conditions, ALK-2 is upregulated in response to increased signaling of pro-inflammatory cytokines, especially interleukin-6 (IL-6), and enhances the secretion of hepcidin, a peptide liver hormone and a key modulator of iron homeostasis. Blocking ALK-2-mediated pathways in inflammation and cancer leads to a decrease of hepcidin expression and restores plasma iron levels, thereby preventing low serum iron levels and anemia of chronic disease (ACD). ALK-2, a serine/threonine receptor kinase, is constitutively activated due to activating mutations or upregulated upstream signaling pathways in inflammatory conditions and certain types of cancer.",ncit:C156729,,New PD,
