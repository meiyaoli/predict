birthdate,demographics,,text,Date of birth,,"Record the date/time according to the ISO 8601, the International Standard for the representation of dates and times (http://www.iso.org/iso/home.html).  The date/time should be recorded to the level of granularity known (e.g., year, year and month, complete date plus hours and minutes, etc.).  Recording date of birth will give the most detailed information required for calculation of age and is recommended as first choice. However, in some studies recording date of birth may elicit discussions on a potential violation of privacy legislation and specifically HIPAA regulations. In these cases, the calculated age should be recorded.",datetime_seconds_ymd,,,,,,,,,,C00007

Response is obtained by report of the participant/subject or caretaker. If more detailed characterizations of ethnicity are collected to enhance data quality and consistency, it is recommended that they be collapsible up to the two categories for reportable ethnicity as needed for reporting to FDA under its guidance. Other regulatory bodies may expect the reporting of ethnicity values which more appropriately reflect the population of their areas (e.g. Japanese ancestry for MHLW reporting to Japan). These may be collected as an extension to the suggested code list.",,,,,,,,,,,C00020

Response is obtained by report of the participant/subject or caretaker. Collecting information on race may not be allowed in some countries for concerns related to discrimination. In other countries, however, these concerns are considered a reason for recording race in order to guarantee equal access to care. Investigators receiving funding from the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) are required to report the number of subjects enrolled on an annual basis using the racial categories listed.",,,,,,,,,,,C00030

Certificate and technical programs do NOT count no matter how specialized.  The number of  years of typical completion of the relevant program is counted. If the subject obtained their education outside the United States, ask about their educational system to estimate the correct coding - Internship, Residency, and Fellowship years are experiential training and do not count.",number,0.0,30.0,,,,,,,,C00015
