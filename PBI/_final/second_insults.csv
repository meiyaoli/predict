cardarrestind,second_insults,,dropdown,Did participant/subject expierence cardiac arrest?,"1, Yes | 2, No | 3, Suspected | 4, Unknown","Choose one. This element is recommended for pediatric studies. Second insults may aggravate processes of secondary damage in a brain already rendered vulnerable by the primary injury. The main physiologic insults relevant to TBI are hypotension, hyper- or hypothermia, hypoxia, and hypocapnia due to hyperventilation. The adverse effect of the occurrence of such insults both pre- and in-hospital is well established.  Second insults are commonly defined by threshold values but these values are not well established in pediatrics. Based on the available data for pediatric TBI , thresholds of 80-180 mg/dL for glucose are recommended. A threshold for hemoglobin is more difficult to define given emerging data on the lower limit of hemoglobin safely tolerated by critically ill children in general and the variable effect of blood transfusion in children with severe TBI specifically.",,,,,,,,,,,C05459
seizind,second_insults,,dropdown,Did participant/subject experience seizure(s)?,"1, Yes | 2, No | 3, Suspected | 4, Unknown","Choose one. Seizure activity in the brain may cause focal or generalized vasodilation with increased cerebral blood volume and high intracranial pressure. Moreover, metabolic requirements are increased in a situation where brain metabolism is already compromised. Seizures are therefore an important second insult following TBI.",,,,,,,,,,,C05460
seizpresenttyp,second_insults,,dropdown,Presentation of seizure,"1, Convulsive | 2, Non-convulsive","Choose one. This element is only answered if the participant/subject had a seizure. This element is recommended for pediatric studies. Second insults are commonly defined by threshold values but these values are not well established in pediatrics. Based on the available data for pediatric TBI , thresholds of 80-180 mg/dL for glucose are recommended. A threshold for hemoglobin is more difficult to define given emerging data on the lower limit of hemoglobin safely tolerated by critically ill children in general and the variable effect of blood transfusion in children with severe TBI specifically.",,,,,,,,,,,C05461
