heartrate,vital_signs_and_other_body_measures,,text,Heart rate,,"Record heart rate from monitor or by counting pulse rate.  The suggested range is 0-300. Add date stamp for when assessed. Heart rate may be altered by trauma in a couple of ways. Tachycardia may indicate volume depletion, pain or stress, and higher heart rates have been found in patients that do not survive traumatic injuries. Bradycardia may be seen with elevated intracranial pressure. Pediatric-specific notes:  As a minimum, vital signs should be recorded on admission and further, on a daily basis during the acute phase after injury. For the basic datasets, we recommend recording the average and lowest blood pressure over a given period. In the ICU environment, recording blood pressure on an hourly basis is recommended, especially when intracranial pressure (ICP) is monitored in order to permit determination of CPP, calculated as mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) - ICP (intermediate data set).",number,0.0,300.0,,,,,,,,C01521

Exclude values which may be influenced by artifacts. Add date stamp for when assessed. The injured brain is often not able to pressure autoregulate normally, adequate perfusion may be more dependent on perfusion pressure; lower blood pressure and low perfusion pressure can aggravate ischemic damage to the injured brain whilst conversely a high blood pressure may lead to increased intracranial pressure and carries an increased risk of neurogenic lung edema. Hypotensive episodes before and after admission adversely affect outcome. In patients with severe traumatic brain injury, routine calculation of the cerebral perfusion pressure on an hourly basis is recommended.
